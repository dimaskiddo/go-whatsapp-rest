# Go WhatsApp Implementation in REST API

This repository contains example of implementation [Rhymen/go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) package. This example is using a codebase from [dimaskiddo/codebase-go-rest-lite](https://github.com/dimaskiddo/codebase-go-rest-lite).

### Warning

Since WhatsApp is migrating to Multi-Device support then this repository might be unusable in the future. For Go WhatsApp REST with Multi-Device support please visit the new repository [dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest](https://github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-multidevice-rest)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Prequisites package:
* Go (Go Programming Language)
* Dep (Go Dependencies Management Tool)
* Make (Automated Execution using Makefile)

Optional package:
* GoReleaser (Go Automated Binaries Build)
* Docker (Application Containerization)

### Installing

Below is the instructions to make this codebase running:
* Create a Go Workspace directory and export it as the extended GOPATH directory
```
cd <your_go_workspace_directory>
export GOPATH=$GOPATH:"`pwd`"
```
* Under the Go Workspace directory create a source directory
```
mkdir -p src/github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-rest
```
* Move to the created directory and pull codebase
```
cd src/github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-rest
git clone -b master https://github.com/dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-rest.git .
```
* Run following command to pull dependecies package
```
make vendor
```
* Until this step you already can run this code by using this command
```
make run
```

## Running The Tests

Currently the test is not ready yet :)

## Deployment

To build this code to binaries for distribution purposes you can run following command:
```
make release
```
The build result will shown in build directory
Or use Docker Images available in dimaskiddo/go-whatsapp-rest

## API Access

You can access any endpoint under **ROUTER_BASE_PATH** configuration by default located at */api/v1/whatsapp*.
Configuration files are located in *share/etc* directory.
